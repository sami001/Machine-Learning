1) Open the linear_regression.m file in MATLAB.

2) In MATLAB command window, type command in the following format:

linear_regression <training_file> <degree> <lambda>

3) For training file and test file paths, the path string can not contain any SPACESs. That means, all diretory names and file names should be space removed.

For example, "C:\data sets\yeast_test.txt" is an invalid pathname. But "C:\data_sets\yeast_test.txt" is valid.

4) After typing the command, press ENTER.
